## About

This is a **learning project** to build an advanced e-commerce website in React.  
I used **Context API + useReducer** for state management to handle cart, wishlist, stock, discounts, search, and sorting **without props drilling**.  
It helped me practice **scalable component design** and dynamic state handling.
